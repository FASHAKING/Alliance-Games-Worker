# Alliance-Games-Worker
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your device, connecting to the network, and starting to earn $WORK tokens.

# What is $WORK?
The $WORK token is a crucial component of the Alliance Games ecosystem, designed to incentivize participation and ensure the performance and stability of the decentralized network.


# Key features:

1. Incentive Mechanism:
Node Rewards: Worker nodes earn $WORK tokens based on their machine type and performance, particularly uptime. This incentivizes users to join the network and contribute their resources.
Alpha Phase Rewards: During the alpha launch phase, tasks on the platform are pre-designed to test the stability and performance of nodes.

2. Multi-Blockchain Support:
$WORK supports multiple blockchains, ensuring flexibility and wide accessibility within the network.

3. Non-Transferable Nature:
$WORK tokens are non-transferable, promoting long-term commitment from node operators. They can be exchanged into $COA tokens after the TGE of $COA.

4. Role in Task Allocation:
Post-Alpha Phase: The network will begin to support live games, including Chain of Alliance. Worker nodes will be reimbursed in stablecoins and $WORK tokens based on game usage.
Seniority Tracker: Holding more $WORK increases the likelihood of a node being allocated tasks, thus enhancing potential revenue.

# Earnings Mechanism for Worker Nodes

The earnings mechanism for worker nodes is based on consistent online presence and task completion. Here’s how it works:

## Heartbeat Tasks:
Every 10 seconds, a small heartbeat task is sent to your device to ensure it is online and functioning correctly. These frequent checks help maintain the integrity and reliability of the network.

## Points Assignment:
Points are assigned once every 24 hours based on your device’s uptime and performance. This daily evaluation ensures that only consistently active and reliable nodes are rewarded.

## Uptime Requirement:
To be eligible for points, your device must remain online without any interruptions exceeding 5 minutes within 24 hours. If your device is offline for more than 5 minutes during this time, it will not receive points for that day.

This earnings mechanism ensures that only nodes that are consistently available and reliable contribute to the network and receive rewards. By maintaining a stable and uninterrupted connection, you can maximize your earnings and support the decentralized gaming infrastructure effectively.
